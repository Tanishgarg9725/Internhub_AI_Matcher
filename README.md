# InternHub – AI Internship Matcher

## What I Built
A simple AI-powered system that evaluates how well a student profile matches an internship description and provides actionable feedback.

## Features
- Internship match summary
- Skill gap analysis
- ATS score calculation
- Resume improvement suggestions
- Final recommendation

## How It Works
- Rule-based logic calculates ATS score using skill overlap
- Google Gemini LLM generates reasoning-based insights
- Implemented as a minimal Streamlit web app

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Google Gemini API
- python-dotenv

## Assumptions
- Skills are self-reported by the student
- ATS score is heuristic-based
- AI does not fabricate skills
